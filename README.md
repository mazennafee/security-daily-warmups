## ✍️ Example Note
File: `http/http-request-response.md`

```markdown
# Lesson: HTTP Request & Response

## 📖 Source
- Platform: TryHackMe
- Lab: HTTP Basics
- Date: 2025-12-10

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- HTTP is a stateless protocol between client and server.
- Request → method, headers, body.
- Response → status code, headers, body.

## 🛠️ Commands
- `curl -v http://example.com`
- `nc -lvnp 8080`

## 🚀 Observations
- Practiced GET vs POST differences.
- Saw how headers change server behavior.
